Rename a [`vfile`][vfile].

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install vfile-rename
```

## Use

```js
import {toVFile as vfile} from 'to-vfile'
import {rename} from 'vfile-rename'

var file = vfile('readme.md')
file.path // => readme.md

// Set extname:
rename(file, '.html')
file.path // => readme.html

// Set basename:
rename(file, 'main.md')
file.path // => main.md

// Set path properties:
rename(file, {stem: 'index'})
file.path // => index.md

// Change path properties:
rename(file, {stem: {suffix: '.bak'}})
file.path // => index.bak.md

// All together:
rename(file, ['readme.md', '.htm', {stem: 'index', extname: {suffix: 'l'}}])
file.path // => index.html
```

## API

This package exports the following identifiers: `rename`, `convert`.
There is no default export.

### `rename(file, renames)`

Renames the given `file` with `renames`.

Converts `renames` to a [move][], and calls that move with `file`.
If you’re doing a lot of renames, use `convert` (`rename.convert` or
`require('vfile-rename/convert')` directly).

###### Parameters

*   `renames` (`string`, `Function`, `Spec`, or `Array<rename>`, optional)

###### Returns

The given `file`.

### `convert(renames)`

Create a function (the [move][]) from `renames`, that when given a file changes
its path properties.

###### Parameters

*   `renames` (`string`, `Function`, `Spec`, or `Array<rename>`, optional)

###### Returns

A [move][].

#### `move(file)`

When given something, returns a [vfile][] from that, and changes its path
properties.

*   If there is no bound rename (it’s null or undefined), makes sure `file` is a
    [`VFile`][vfile]
*   If the bound rename is a normal string starting with a dot (`.`), sets
    `file.extname`
*   Otherwise, if the bound rename is a normal string, sets `file.basename`
*   If the bound test is an array, all renames in it are performed
*   Otherwise, if the bound rename is an object, renames according to the
    [`Spec`][spec]

### `Spec`

A spec is an object describing path properties to values.
For each property in `spec`, if its value is `string`, the value of the path
property on the given file is set.
If the value is `object`, it can have a `prefix` or `suffix` key, the value of
the path property on the given file is prefixed and/or suffixed.

Note that only [allowed][] path properties can be set, other properties are
thrown for.
